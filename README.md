# Bannergress Map Display

This project displays banners from [Bannergress](https://bannergress.com) on a map.

## Features

- Display multiple banners on a single map.
- Display all banners from a place, such as a city or a country, by pasting the place's "browse" URL.
- Display an elevation graph for a banner to check whether you need to go up and down any hills.
- Share a set of banners with others or store it for use on your phone later.
- Export Drawtools JSON files of banners for easy visualisation of existing banners while planning new routes with UMM.

## Usage

1. Go to https://simbabque.github.io/ingress-banner-mapper/.
2. Paste your Bannergress links into the textarea. This can be an individual banner or a whole area.
3. Click the "Show banners" button to display the banners on the map.
4. Click the "Clear banners" button to remove all banners from the map.


## Presetting a banner or zoom to share with others

You can pass in the `banners` URL parameter to make the page prepoluate and load a specific banner or area. Here's an example:

https://simbabque.github.io/ingress-banner-mapper/?banners=https://bannergress.com/banner/francesinha-8c71

If you want to add multiple banners, use url-encoded newlines (`%0A`) or spaces (`%20`) as the delimiter and pass them all into the same `banners` parameter: 

https://simbabque.github.io/ingress-banner-mapper/?banners=https://bannergress.com/banner/london-xm-research-7b96%0Ahttps://bannergress.com/banner/rotherhide-ingressfs-august-2024-5245%0Ahttps://bannergress.com/banner/gen-x-in-canada-water-8dfa

## Finding banners based on a place

You can also pass in the `place` URL parameter. We will try to use the Bannergress API to find the next best place and fetch all banners. The output may vary as these places are not sorted. For parts of London, there may be two or more results, and calling it multiple times may return different things each time.

## Different ways of sharing what you've done

There are various different options for sharing and saving the banners you've curated. Use the 'ðŸ“¤' button on the top right side of the map
to open the Export dialog. This will open a dialog, and you can then choose from the following.

### Copy sharable link

This creates a sharable URL of the current set of banners to the clipboard. This will include
everything on the map, but not where your map is scrolled to. It does not take the content of the text box at the bottom of the
screen into account. It is intended to be used to store or share a curated list of banners.

### Download Drawtools JSON

This option lets you export all visible banners as a JSON file compatible with Drawtools. It creates a downloadable file containing all banner routes as polylines with their coordinates and colors. The exported file will be automatically named with the current location and timestamp, for example: `banners_London_2025-09-03-14-30-15.json`.

You can then use this to import the routes into IITC with Drawtools. It is useful for planning new routes while avoiding existing ones.

### Show all banners URLs

This will open a list with the URLs for all visible banners for easy copy/pasting as well as quickly opening all of them in new tabs for
further processing, such as adding them to your TODO list in Bannergress.

There are also buttons to _Copy All_ of them, as well as to _Open All_. Please not that opening all of them in new tabs via this 
functionality is likely going to cause your browser's pop-up blocking to engage, and you will have to explicitly allow it to open these tabs
the first time you use this function.

## Hiding the navigation panel

You can use the 'â˜°' (hamburger menu) button in the top-right corner of the map to show or hide the navigation panel. This is useful when you want to:

- Get a full-screen view of the map for presentations or screenshots
- Maximize map space when viewing many banners
- Quickly switch between navigation and map-only views

You can also hide the navigation panel permanently by appending the `bare=1` URL parameter. This is useful if you want to present a fixed view of a specific set of banners, such as providing a link for the banners in the area of a First Saturday event:
